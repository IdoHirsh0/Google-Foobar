Google's foobar challenge üèÜ

In this repo I'll document my experience in google's foobar challenge.

## What's google foobar?
[Google foobar](https://foobar.withgoogle.com), is Google's *secret* recruiting process embedded within their search engine. There are 5 levels, each with a different number of challenges that follow a story.

Checkout [journal.md](https://github.com/ido-hi/google-foobar/blob/master/journal.md) for the overall story with each level.


## What's in this repo?
Here you can find many of the google foobar challenge questions, some I got when I participated, and some I gathered from other people online.

The repo is seperated into the different levels, and in each level there are the problems related to that level. In each problem folder you can find a README that explains the problem, and a solution file with my solution to the problem.

## The challenges
Google foobar consists of 5 levels, each with different algorithmic problems. It was really a great experience so far. The first few levels were relatively easy, but as the levels peaked up, the difficulty gained heights.

### Level 1
On this level I had to solve 1 qustion, and had 7 days to solve it. I dealted with fairly simple **Encryption** concepts.
- [I Love Lance & Janice](https://github.com/ido-hi/google-foobar/tree/master/level-1/i-love-lance-janice)

### Level 2
On this level I had to solve 2 qustions, and had 7 days to solve each. I used an intro level **Dynamic Programming** concepts for solving these challenges.
- [Hey, I Already Did That!](https://github.com/ido-hi/google-foobar/tree/master/level-2/hey-i-already-did-that)
- [Power Hungry](https://github.com/ido-hi/google-foobar/tree/master/level-2/power-hungry)

After completing level 2 I got a single use shareable inventation link to the foobar challenge, so I could invite anyone I want!

### Level 3
